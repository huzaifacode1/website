<p>The history of pizza begins in antiquity, as various ancient cultures produced flatbreads with several toppings.

  A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings<br> were then added.[1] Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, between the 16th and mid-18th century.[2][3]
  
  The word pizza was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta[4] and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy.<br> Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War<br> II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>
